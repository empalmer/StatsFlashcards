# StatsFlashcards

## About

Created for studying for my OSU grad stats comps

Two folders are Methods and Theory, for the first year year-long sequences. Each has several .tex files corresponding to the topic the flashcards cover (which correspond to tags in anki). To have a full deck of flashcards, import each file. (Note this conversion of 1 file overall to multiple separate files corresponding to different tags is in progress ) Note the tags contain a version number so old or updated cards can be easily deleted. 

These flashcards are intended to use with the free Anki software https://apps.ankiweb.net

The desktop version is needed to open a .tex document, and requires a local LaTeX installation. You can then sync the flashcards with Ankiweb https://ankiweb.net after creating an account, which can be accessed on web or mobile devices (iOS app costs, but accessing via mobile browser works great for me).

The pdf files have an overview of all the flashcards, but are not intended to be used to study

## In progress flashcards
### Theory
 - Theory 2
 - Theory 3
 - Useful math facts
 - Distribution relationships

 ## Methods

## My workflow to use these flashcards:
- Make sure the latex header matches the document: Go Tools>Manage Note Types> Options, and paste the correct latex header in the Header section
- Import the .tex flashcard file from the main screen by clicking Import file
- Make sure the "Deck" selected is the one intended to import to - You can either select or add a deck at this time
- Make sure all LaTeX has been rendered by Tools>Check Media... Click Render LaTeX
- Click Sync
- You should be able to access these flashcards anywhere!

## If you want to study a specific topic (eg Distribution Relationships)
 - On desktop version, click on deck
 - At bottom, click Custom Study
 - Click Select by card state or tag > Choose Tags
 - Select tag of interest
 - This will create a new deck with only the flashcards of interest
